👋 Hi, I’m @Abdul3442
I’m a Biotechnology student and aspiring bioinformatician with a keen interest in computational biology, genomics, and molecular drug discovery. I’m currently enhancing my skills in protein structure analysis, molecular docking, and in-silico drug design. I’ve recently completed a bioinformatics internship at The Freelance Bubble by Sir Maaz Waseem, where I gained hands-on experience with sequence analysis, homology modeling, and molecular visualization tools. I’m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics research projects, especially those involving structural biology, machine learning in life sciences, or molecular dynamics.
You can reach me at: abdulrehman14432@gmail.com OR

My goal is to bridge the gap between wet-lab biotechnology and computational bioinformatics through innovative research and collaboration.
